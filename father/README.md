Some dirt I made for my father to address issues he's had.

xautoscroll is an auto scroller written in bash, using yad for a GUI, and xdotool for scrolling under the mouse cursor.
 My father didn't like the built in scroller because moving the mouse caused it to change speed and it was too sensitive.
 
 zapp is a zenity/bash tool for pulling stuff off an android phone using adb.
  My father frequently pulled pictures and videos from his phone and its slow and buggy over mtp, where adb is much faster, but no real GUI exists for it.
