Herein lies some miscellaneous stuff I wrote to deal with mate-panel, may this
dirt rest in peace.

There is a udev rule I use to detect docking/undocking on my thinkpad so I can change panel configuration, a bash script for that, as well as a bash script for loading/saving panel configuration, as well as a python script decamp for removing cruft from a mate-panel configuration.

If you don't know why decamp is necessary, you haven't really used mate-panel much :P
